-What I learned about SEO and analytics-

Previously I thought that web developers handle the SEO for their sites. This week I learned that it's actually the marketing team that handles the SEO, which makes sense in retrospect. I had heard of SEO previously and knew it was very important, but didn't realize it was so complex and now it makes sense that there would be people who specialize in just SEO. I also find it fascinating that Google is often changing it's SEO algorithms so people don't game the system.

What really struck a chord with me from the SEO class video was learning the importance of organic web traffic as compared to the paid search results. Like Aaron I also always skip over the sponsored links at the top of the search results and I always scroll down to the organic results even if the exact site I am looking for is one of the sponsered results. The sponsored links just always felt "dirty" and wrong to me for some reason and now I know the reason why and have an actual explanation for it.

I also now understand the benefits of analytics and heat maps for making sure my visitors can easily find the info that is important to them on my sites. Both can assist me with re-tooling my sites to make them more user friendly which will increase organic traffic and re-visits.

-How I would ideally implement SEO on my site-

The first thing I'd be sure to do is make sure my site is accessible to search engine crawlers so they can properly access my site's content. I would also make sure my site has compelling content that fits what potential visitors are searching for on search engines. I would also prioritize the visitor's experience making sure the site is well organized and the content is concise. I would use analytics and heat maps to continually evaluate how visitors use my site and update it accordingly. I would prioritize placement of the frequently used sections and features of my site making it easier to find or use. I would also make sure that site's UX is pleasant and exciting on all devices. I want the visitor to be able to browse my site with ease but also maybe have a little fun while doing it. I would probably hire a UX designer, or at least consult with one, as they are experts on the subject. 

Although it's not necessarily SEO, I will make sure to add social media tags and share buttons for the popular social media sites and apps. Sure, people can just copy and paste my site's url, but I want to have some control over how my site is presented on the various social media platforms; I want it to look sharp, professional and appealing.
